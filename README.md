# pyTAB

### Python Transcoding Acceleration Benchmark


# Testing guide for [pyTAB](https://github.com/BotBlake/pytab)
_pyTAB is in heavy development a.t.m. so expect it to be laggy and crash_
_Since it is a Hardware Benchmark, it will try to use as many System Ressources as possible!_

### Software requirements
Also pyTAB is build as a python module via poetry. Therefore you need to have at least python 3.11.2 and poetry installed on your system. 
poetry is installed via pipx using: `pipx install poetry`
If you do not have pipx installed, follow the [official install guide](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) 

Its also required to have access to a running instance of Venson's [Jellyfin Hardware Visualizer](https://github.com/JPVenson/Jellyfin.HardwareVisualizer). More information about that is available in the GitHub repo. 

### installing pyTAB
1. Clone the GitHub Repository `git clone https://github.com/BotBlake/pyTAB`
2. Go into the pytab Folder `cd pytab`
3. Switch to the development branch `git switch develop`
4. Open the venv shell `poetry shell`
5. Install Dependencies `poetry install`
_To exit the Shell: `exit`_

Since the state of the software often Changes, you might have to do some "additional steps" to ensure its running correctly. They are explained down below.

### running pyTAB
 1. open the poetry shell `poetry shell`
2. run the script `pytab --server "https://Your/Test/Server/"`
_If you want / need specific info about all the CLI Arguments, do `pytab -h` _

### additional Steps
_During development pyTAB may require you to set up specific things manually these will change over Time_
- Make sure you are on the latest version `git pull`
- Take a Look into the "Current Issues" section


## Current Issues:

_The Server API currently still uses the Old Jellyfin Repositories to Download ffmpeg. Since theese do not work, you have to download the Archive / File yourself and provide them to pyTAB_
- Download [Windows](https://repo.jellyfin.org/files/ffmpeg/windows/latest-5.x/amd64/jellyfin-ffmpeg_5.1.4-3-portable_win64.zip) / [Ubuntu](https://repo.jellyfin.org/files/ffmpeg/ubuntu/latest-6.x/amd64/jellyfin-ffmpeg6_6.0.1-7-focal_amd64.deb) 
- run pytab with the option `--ffmpeg "PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER`  (!not the file itself!)

_Since a lot of Hardware recognition is not yet implemented for Linux based Systems, these are currently not supported. Try running the Script on Windows instead._
- Use Windows ðŸ—¿ 

_To reduce Test Runtime (and because proper support isnt yet implemented, there are a few limitations on what devices pyTAB uses at the moment)_
- Only NVIDIA GPUs
- No CPU Tests _(can be enabled manually)_
- No Support for AMD / Intek GPU's yet
- Script will always use the first GPU that it can find
